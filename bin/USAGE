USAGE: ssb-webify

  init
    Start a new dynamic website. Publishes a new `web-init` message to SSB and
    records it in `.ssb-web`.

  publish DIR
    Publish DIR as a website to SSB. If there is a local `.ssb-web` file in the
    current directory, a `web-root` message is also published pointing to this
    as the latest version of the site. Otherwise, it is published as a static
    site (just the blobs are published to SSB).
